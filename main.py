# #1. Create a greeting for your program.
# print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
# #2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
# city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
# #3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
# pet = input("What's your pet's name? \n")
# #4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
# print("Your band name could be " + city +" "+ pet)
# #5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:
